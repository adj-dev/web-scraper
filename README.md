# web-scraper
A simple web scraper app that uses **cheerio**, **mongoose**, and **axios**. 

## How to Use

Click on the scrape button to generate a list of articles from [infoworld.com](https://www.infoworld.com/category/web-development/). Once the articles are rendered you then have the option to save an article, which adds it to the "saved articles" page where you are free to make a note attached to each saved article. Only saved articles can have notes. Also, the app will no scrape for articles that have already been saved, this prevents duplicate articles and helps to keep the app cleaner.
